                <p class='description'>I'm Anthony Pizzimenti, a developer working for West High's <i>West Side Story</i>. I work primarily in Java and frontend design languages. 
                I thoroughly enjoy and play hockey, love StarCraft II, and adore food. Here are a few samples of my work,
                as well as links for GitHub repos which I update regularly.</p>

                    </div>

                        <h2>working with a team</h2>
                        <p>I've talked with the others vying for the web development spots, and they've agreed it'd be
                            great to work with a team. A small, close-knit group of developers working in an open environment will
                            generate the best, most efficient, and highest-quality content available. This will also help with
                            communication between the website people and non-website people, as ideas can be presented and then
                            bounced around between the developers to see whether it's feasible, implementable, and will benefit
                            the paper as a whole.</p><br />

                        <h2>worknights and workdays</h2>
                        <p>If it isn't already happening, I think there should be some time allocated to the website and its
                            improvement. All of the developers are extremely dedicated to their craft, and I feel that a little time
                            set aside once in a while would help us better grasp what needs to be done and what we've done well. It'll
                            also allow for reasonable scheduling and deadlines, giving the team a structured timetable for work completion. Having this time 
                            would also help everyone pull in the same direction in terms of what's needed, wanted, and unnecessary.</p><br />

                        <h2>projects</h2>
                        <p>There are a few projects that I'd like to work on, namely addons for the site. Before all that, though,
                            everything starts with documentation. With the team, I'd like to organize a system where we can update 
                            and catalog all the work that goes into the website on Github. Also, I'd like us to begin working on a few comprehensive 
                            sidebar pieces that would integrate well and look good.</p>
                        <br />

I really like making easter eggs.

Go forth, my constituents, and code more!
