This is a single HTML page dedicated to showcasing my work. It's small, clean, and organized, and I love it with all my heart. I worked
for a good amount of time trying to figure out an aesthetic that'd work well with the theme of what's being presented, and I think I 
found it after a while.

####The Work
This wasn't supposed to be a complicated project, but I tried to find a way to effectively display my 'ideas' pane, and discovered that 
there wasn't a really effective way to do the stuff I wanted without jQuery, so I went for it. The majority of the animations and 
transitions have changed, but most of the styles have remained the same.

####Blogger
Since this is hosted by Google's Blogger and I couldn't find a theme that was really suitable for the purpose of the site, I elected 
to delete the Blogger theme and just make my own HTML page (as you've probably discovered). However, Blogger only accepts HTML contained 
in XML, and so I had to include the ``<b:skin>`` and ``<b:template-skin>`` tags just to be able to push it to the site. I got around it 
alright, though, and it's working so far.

####Styling
I had done mostly inline styling since I hadn't found a reasonable place to host stylesheets. Then I discovered that I could host them from 
one of my favorite servies, Dropbox, which I use daily for every file I create and use.

Anyways, I created the scheme change and slide-down effects using a bit of JavaScript and jQuery.
